# Wordmorph
This is a small app that finds paths between words from a dictionary



Wordmorph is program implemented in C.

Given two words and a maximum number of mutations, this program will produce the shortest possible sequence of words, in which each word is obtained by replacing a certain number of characters from its predecessor so that the next word exists in the given dictionary.
